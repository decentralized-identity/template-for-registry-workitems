# Template Instructions

1. Assign work item leads by their github handles in the [CODEOWNERS]() file.
2. Tag overseeing WG with that WG's tag (i.e. #ccwg)
3. Assign orgs/teams within DIF and openness to external PRs depending on IPR policy
4. Get to definitioning. A starter document structure can be found in `single-file-test/spec.md`. This guide can be expanded and altered but folling the highlevel strucutre will make it easier for readrs to get up to speed with the profile.
